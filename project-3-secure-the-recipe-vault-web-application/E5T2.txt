1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
a. Scan infrastructure as code templates.
Checkov (https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov).
- scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform, Terraform plan, Cloudformation, AWS SAM, Kubernetes, Helm charts, Kustomize, 
Dockerfile, Serverless, Bicep, OpenAPI or ARM Templates and detects security and compliance misconfigurations using graph-based scanning.
- Scan of open source packages and images for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) 

TFLint (https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
- Find possible errors (like invalid instance types) for Major Cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Warn about deprecated syntax, unused declarations.
- Enforce best practices, naming conventions.
  
CloudSploit (https://github.com/aquasecurity/cloudsploit)
- detection of security risks in cloud infrastructure accounts, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and GitHub. Return a series of potential misconfigurations and security risks.

Trivy (https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- Comprehensive and versatile security scanner.
- IaC issues and misconfigurations, Sensitive information and secrets.

b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 
Clair (https://github.com/quay/clair)
- Static analysis of vulnerabilities in application containers (currently including OCI and docker).

Anchore (https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine)
- Container scanning and compliance. 
- Inspection, analysis, and certification of container images

Trivy (https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
- OS packages and software dependencies in use (SBOM), Known vulnerabilities (CVEs), Software licenses.

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
AWS Config (https://aws.amazon.com/config/): Assess, audit, and evaluate configurations of your resources

AWS Security Hub (https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/): Automate AWS security checks and centralize security alerts

AWS Inspector (https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/): Detect software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure in near real time in AWS workloads such as 
Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon ECR.

AWS GuardDuty (https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/): Continuously monitor your AWS accounts, instances, serverless and container workloads, users, databases, 
and storage for potential threats.
