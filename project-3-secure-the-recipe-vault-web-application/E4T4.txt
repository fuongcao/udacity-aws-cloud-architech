1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Application Load Balancer should be reconfigure the Application Load Balancer to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
- Web-application EC2 instance shoulb be in private subnet, allow access internet through a NAT Gateway. 

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent 
the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- The VPC private endpoints couldn't solve this. When attacker sat in VPC, they still access to s3 bucket. 

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- The default encryption setting to the S3 buckets will not encrypt the data that already exists. 
The existed data should be re-update to be encrypted.

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; 
describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
- Cloudformation will not found that the changes have applied, so if the original cloud formation templates are applied, nothing will be updated.
We should use cloudformation deploy instead of update command if need to reset the change to original cloud formation templates.
